Whether you're applying to schools, hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, or private practices, this article will walk you through the process of creating a strong CV specifically for speech therapists.

1. Select the Appropriate Format for Your Resume

2. Employ a Professional Header First
Your complete name, work title, and current contact details (phone number, email address, and maybe LinkedIn profile) should all appear in the heading of your resume. Make sure your contact details are visible and professional.

Make it unique to the position you're looking for by highlighting your abilities that meet the requirements of the business.

For instance, "Trained speech-language pathologist with more than five years of experience identifying and treating communication, language, and speech disorders in both adult and pediatric patients." competent in creating personalized treatment programs, carrying out assessments, and working with multidisciplinary teams to enhance patient results.

- Candidates at Entry Level: If you're just getting started, emphasize your education and passion for the industry in your career aim.
